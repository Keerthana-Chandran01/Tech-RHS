# Prediction of Health Insurance Fraud Claim Using Supervided Machine Learning

 # MOTIVATION FOR THE PROJECT
 To prevent the serious losses to the insurance company and also increase the revenue of the company by avoiding wastages on false claim and increase the customer satisfication.The process being with relation of features based on information gained and is followed by the creation of prediction using various machine learning techniques.For developing this model to avoid the frauds in healthcare insurance claims by automatically acknowledging whether in customers claim is frauds or not. 
# ABSTRACT
The healthcare industry is a complex system and it is expanding at a rapid pace. At the same time fraud in this industry is turning into a critical problem.
Machine learning and data mining techniques are used for automatically detecting the healthcare frauds. In this paper, we attempt to give a review on frauds in healthcare industry and the techniques for detecting such frauds.
Different  machine  learning  algorithm  are carried  out  in  this paper Random Forest , Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression is used predict the fraud claim.
To use bivariate and univariate analysis in this project .
# SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS
Operating System 	: Windows 10 or later
Tool   		            : Anaconda with Jupiter Notebook
# HARDWARE REQUIREMENT
Processor   		: Intel i3
Hard disk   		: minimum 10 GB

# ALGORITHM IMPLEMENTATION WITH ACCURACY 
It is important to compare the performance of multiple different machine learning algorithms consistently .
Random forests or random decision forests are an ensemble learning method for classification, regression and other tasks, that operate by constructing a multitude of decision trees at training time and outputting the class that is the mode of the classes (classification) or mean prediction (regression) of the individual trees
