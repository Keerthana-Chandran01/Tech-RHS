# Prediction of Health Insurance Fraud Claim Using Supervided Machine Learning

 # MOTIVATION FOR THE PROJECT
In our modern culture, if a single person, particularly a woman, must travel not only during the day but also at night, there is a sense of insecurity, a lack of trust in the driver, and all of this produces worry for the rider, therefore we picked this.
To improve their personal safety, and make their surroundings more secure in order to foster a sense of confidence and peace of mind among all of them.

# ABSTRACT
Our driver verification application seeks to create a reliable and safe conduit between clients, drivers, and service providers.
Drivers are put through a rigorous verification procedure, which includes police verification, upon registration in order to verify their validity and compliance with safety regulations. 
Network security technique and  AES algorithm are employed to nurture a safe and efficient ride-hailing environment.
We want to encourage openness, accountability, dependability.

# SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS
The software requirements provide a basis for creating the software requirements specification.  It is useful in estimating cost, planning team activities, performing tasks and tracking the teams and tracking the teamâ€™s progress throughout the development activity.
